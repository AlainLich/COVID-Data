# Information on Data Sets

## Goal
As time advances, we become aware of more and more sets of information and data;
this page enables to:
  1. keep comments in what we find and on potential exploitation plans.
  2. give indications of format changes that have been noticed

	   which 
	   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53927460/select-rows-in-pandas-multiindex-dataframe 
	   has a quite comprehensive explanation on slicing multi-indices...
	   
   1. test `DGTestFRAPI.test_rqt7get` has been added to `source/lib/testDataMgr.py`,
      mostly to check method for discovering the relevant files/data

      on `badge`not feasible; however searching  on `tag` and `slug`do work. 
   1. We have responded by
      + widening the set of supported API requests, therefore
        introducing object class `manageAndCacheDataFilesFRAPI`
	  + adding some interrogation capabilities
   1. See the tests (file `source/lib/testDataMgr.py` `DGTestFRAPI.*`) 
      or the example in Jupyter files
