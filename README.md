https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/donnees-des-urgences-hospitalieres-et-de-sos-medecins-relatives-a-lepidemie-de-covid-19/

basic script to work with the [Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases dataset provided by JHU CSSE](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/)

Mostly this consists of jupyter notebook(s), while python scripts are also provided
almost direct transpositions of the notebooks.


## Aim:
There are many good and interesting contributions on the pages 
https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-hospitalieres-relatives-a-lepidemie-de-covid-19
and
https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/donnees-des-urgences-hospitalieres-et-de-sos-medecins-relatives-a-lepidemie-de-covid-19/,
however this is a very straightforward piece of code, intended mostly to facilitate
access to the data for testing personal "what-if" hypotheses.
